        'The pH of water measures how acidic or alkaline the water is. A pH of 7 is considered neutral, while values below 7 are acidic and above 7 are alkaline. The pH of the Ganga River is important as it affects aquatic life. A balanced pH ensures that fish and other organisms can thrive. If the water becomes too acidic or too alkaline, it harms these organisms and disrupts the natural ecosystem.',

        'Dissolved Oxygen (DO) refers to the amount of oxygen present in the water. Oxygen is essential for the survival of aquatic creatures like fish and plants. High DO levels indicate good water quality, supporting a healthy ecosystem. Low DO levels, often caused by pollution, can lead to the death of aquatic life. Therefore, monitoring DO levels is crucial to understanding the health of the river.',

        'BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to break down organic material in water. Higher BOD levels mean more pollution, as it indicates that there is more organic waste (like sewage) in the water. This reduces the amount of oxygen available for fish and other aquatic life.

These bacteria themselves are not harmful, but their presence in water suggests that harmful pathogens may also be present. High levels of total coliform in the Ganga indicate contamination, usually due to human or animal waste, which can lead to waterborne diseases.',

The basin includes various tributaries, towns, and cities, making it one of the most densely populated and industrialized regions in the world. Protecting the quality of water in the Ganga is crucial not just for the river, but also for the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on it for drinking, irrigation, and cultural purposes.',
